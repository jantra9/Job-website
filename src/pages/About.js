            <p>The npm run dev command is used to 
            start the development server for your
            Next.js application. When you run this
            command, Next.js starts a development
            server that provides features like hot
            module replacement (HMR) and fast refresh.
            This means that when you make changes to
            your code, the updates are reflected in your
             browser almost instantly, without the need
              for a full page reload</p>
